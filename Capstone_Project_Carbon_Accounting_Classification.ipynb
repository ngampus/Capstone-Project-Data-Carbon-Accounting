Despite corporate commitments to No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation (NDPE) policies, practical implementation remains elusive for many smallholders and even some larger producers.\n",
            "\n",
            "The largest source of GHG emissions stems from land-use changes, especially the conversion of peatlands for oil palm plantations. This process not only releases substantial carbon but also exacerbates environmental degradation through peatland subsidence and uncontrolled fires. The complex interplay of insufficient technical knowledge, limited financial resources, intricate land tenure systems, and pressure for rapid land clearing among producers perpetuates these emissions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Operational challenges include the lack of standardized monitoring and verification of emissions across the supply chain, hindering transparency and accountability. Supply chain issues are compounded by the difficulty in enforcing sustainable practices among smallholders, many of whom operate on a subsistence level and lack the capacity for rigorous compliance with NDPE standards.\n",
            "\n",
            "Strategic opportunities for emission reduction are multifaceted. First, enhancing supplier engagement and capacity building for sustainable practices among smallholders is crucial. This involves providing technical support, financial incentives, and clear land tenure rights to facilitate the adoption of sustainable land management. Second, investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency measures across plantations can significantly reduce operational emissions. Lastly, leveraging technology for precision agriculture and real-time monitoring of peatland conditions can mitigate risks associated with peatland degradation and fires.\n",
